<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a third-year MSc student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I am also a group member of USTC [Intelligent Perception Lab](https://ustc-ip-lab.github.io/), advised by [Prof. Qibin Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bPLvsSAAAAAJ) and [Prof. Yan Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en-EN&user=MVOCn1AAAAAJ).
My research interests include wireless sensing and ubiquitous computing, focusing on developing human-centric sensing systems with cost-effective and privacy-preserving mobile devices.  

The goal of my research is to **enhance the sensing robustness** (e.g., cross-domain gesture and position sensing, sensing under human and device interference) and **augment the sensing resolution** (e.g., near-field SAR imaging, radar point cloud generation), which is crucial for achieving a comprehensive perception of the physical and digital world with millions of wireless devices.
